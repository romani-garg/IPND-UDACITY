              Italy’s great food, beautiful countryside, fabulous wine, and long history make it an excellent country to visit. I fall in love with it every time I go. The vineyards in Tuscany, the history of Florence, the ancient streets in Rome, the laid back nature of Southern Italy, the gorgeous Cinque Terre, and the romantic canals in Venice all make the country irresistible. Italy leaves no one underwhelmed and, with so much to do and see, it would take a lifetime to complete. Italy is best seen slowly – just like the attitude of the country – so don’t rush it in one visit and try to do too much. Relax, take in the scenery, and enjoy a latte.

            <small><b>Accommodation –</b> Hostel dorms average 18-30 EUR per night while private hostels rooms range between 50-100 EUR a night for rooms. Most hostels offer free linens and WiFi. You should expect to spend around 50 EUR per night for the most basic of rooms. For something a little nice and more spacious, look closer to 70 per night. A much better alternative to hotels is Airbnb, where a shared room in someone’s house typically costs around 20 EUR a night and an entire apartment start at about 40 EUR.</small>
          </p></div>

          <div>
            <p class="cbt">
          <small><b>Food –</b>   Italy is known for its cuisine – fresh pasta, bread, tomatoes, pizza, gelato, and wine. It’s easy to have a great (and expensive) meal anywhere in Italy, but it’s also easy to eat for less than 15 EUR a day if you make the effort. Most restaurant meals with wine will cost around 25 EUR per person. In tourist hot spots, add about 10 EUR to that. Quick eats like pizza by the slice, paninis, and light snacks will cost between 2-7 EUR. Fast food (i.e. McDonalds) will cost 9 EUR for a value meal. At most restaurants, add 3 EUR for the “coperto” (sit down fee) that covers service and the bread at the table. If you’re feeling ambitious and staying somewhere with a kitchen, consider cooking your own food for between 50-70 EUR per week. If you find a discount grocer like Eurospin, In’s Mercato, LD Market, Lidl or Penny Market, you’ll pay less.</small>
        </p></div>

            <div>
            <p class="cbt">
            <small><b>Transportation –</b> The best way to get around Italy is via their extensive train network. Fast trains (Eurostar) cost between 35-65 EUR per trip. The slower regional trains cost between 6-25 EUR per trip. (Take them!) For long distances when you are short on time, Ryanair and EasyJet have cheap flights throughout the country. Florence to Rome via train is 29 EUR and takes 95 minutes and by bus, it’s 17 EUR and takes nearly 4 hours. Pisa to Milan via train is 35 EUR and takes about 3.5 hours and by bus, it’s 17 EUR and takes 6.5 hours. Public transportation is reasonably priced with most buses and subways costing at most 2 EUR for a single ticket. Uber is available in six cities in Italy, including Rome, Milan, and Florence.

             <div>
            <p class="cbt">
            <small><b>Activities –</b> Most attractions and museums in Italy cost between 13-20 EUR to enter. Expect more if you’re hoping for a guide in places such as the Vatican or Colosseum. When booking guided tours, some companies will give discounts if you reserve multiple experiences with them. Also, if you are going to do lots of sightseeing, city cards will give you discounts to the top museums, tours, and attractions. They are priced to save you money when compared to buying separate tickets. Wine tours will cost between 60-75 EUR. Cooking classes can be upwards of 100-300 EUR a person depending on how many courses (and how much wine!) is included.</small>
